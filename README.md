This is an experimental project of software to help maintain digital photographs on the NAS server. As a keen photographer, I produce some amount of JPEG and NEF files every year that I need to keep tidy, but so far I haven't seen software that would address my needs to store them on the NAS in a sensible way. Hence the concept of this piece.

## Status
It's early foundation capable to look for potential duplications.

## Vision
Two major components:
* Server-side daemon handling all the files kept on the filesystem
* Client-side (potentially browser-based) user interface to view pictures like in a gallery and tag them for further reference
